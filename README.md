# Employee Tracker

![License Badge](./assets/badge.svg)

## Description

The intended purpose of this application is to help non-developers view and interact with information stored in databases. This application is a _Content Management System (CMS)_ which presents the user/client with a series of prompts to view, manage business departments, assign business roles, and add or edit employees within the company.

My application makes use of the [MySQL 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) package to connect to a MySQL database and perform queries, while [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package is used to present the user with prompts. Since the application's interactions are mainly done in _Command Line Interface (CLI)_, the [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) package was also impletended in order to print MySQL rows to the console.
